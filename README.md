⭐ My Website.  

*I realised how boring frontend developing actually is for me. I hopped from astro + preact to astro + react, then decided to use plain astro pages, then went to opt for tailwind css.*

*It just didn't give me joy and I spent lots of time figuring out responsiveness of this web and **animating** on html literally using keyframes. Plus you cant put any lottie .json animations or can integrate some animations in html that freely as in astro or tailwind.*

*I would absolutely never opt for frontend coding ever again.*

---

*So if the web looks bad and stuff, please bear with me, I had to force myself to make this (It helps in google indexing of my tools **:P**).*

- **25th Feb, 2026:** *I added more animations for fun and experimented with already done animations using keyframes directly in html.*
