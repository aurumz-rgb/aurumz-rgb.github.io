My web.  

I realised how boring frontend developing actually is for me. I hopped from astro + preact to astro + react, then decided to use plain astro pages, then went to opt for tailwind css. 

It just didn't give me joy and I spent lots of time figuring out responsiveness of this web. Plus you cant put any .json animations or can integrated some animations in html that freely as in astro or tailwind.

I would absolutely never opt for frontend coding ever again.

So if the web looks bad and stuff, please bear with me, I had to force myself to make this (It helps in google indexing of my tools :P).
