My web.  

I realised how boring frontend developing actually is for me. I hoped from astro + preact to astro + react, then decided to use plain astro pages, then went to opt for tailwind css. 

It just didn't give me joy and I spent lots of time figuring out responsiveness of this web. I would absolutely never opt for frontend coding ever again.

So if the web looks bad and stuff, please bear with me, I had to force myself to make this (It helps in google indexing of my tools).
